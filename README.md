## TODO
- [ ] Do I need a TOML file / how to handle requirements?
- [x] Create python environment locally and redo the requirements.txt - why is pytest not showing up?
- [ ] Figure out better was to parse and return only True optional args 
- [ ] Local debug
- [ ] How would I make this an installable package instead of an alias in zshrc? 

# .zshrc alias 
`alias ccwc='python3 [ABSOLUTE PATH TO] write_your_own_wc_tool/ccwc/ccwc.py'`
